### for the love of trees

this weekend i watched

the royal tenenbaums, wes anderson  
old joy, kelly reichart  
showing up, kelly reichart  
the brutalist, brady corbet  

my instinct is to record [title, director] as i would [book, author]. this feels appropriate for the first 3 but not the brutalist. huge movie, big big team, more visions than just brady clearly. but then this is the case w any movie right? anyone can write a book, any one person. a film requires a team and coordination.

in the royal tenenbaums i rewatched 3x the scene where luke wilson opens up his arms to needle in the hay and the kid finds him in the bathroom, the rush to the hospital <<< needle in the hay, open mouth yell swallowed by the song—i thought for a second there was gonna be a bit about the kids perceptions bc he’s some wild combination of colorblind and dyslexic that bill murray as oliver sacks was having a time w. but no bit, open mouth yell then the rush to the hospital <<<

that same night i went over to doni’s, the door was open but the screen closed, all the lights were off but the bathroom, it was quiet, i feel my heart beating, my brain runs this scene again, plays needle in the hay, red all over the sink, open mouth yell, i round the corner to peek into the bathroom and she’s just out the shower, cutting her hair. i sigh, kiss her cheek, go to the couch and cry a bit

a few inches off, new bangs, it looks great.

title, author with a book is all there is.

this weekend i reread

the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, douglas adams

and started

the elegance of the hedgehog, muriel barbery
the tin drum, gunter grass
