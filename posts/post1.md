### 3.17.25

In March I‚Äôm turning to long novels.
           
_The Long Form_ by Kate Briggs and _The Last Samurai_ by Helen DeWitt 
if you‚Äôd like to read together.

I've worked in a bookstore for 2 years and I'm still at a complete 
loss when customers ask me what kinds of books I like. Usually I
can sort out the question behind the question and address that
without digging deep for some nonanswer ‚Äî is this pure curiosity,
flirting, maybe I remind them of someone in their life and they're
trying to get a book for them. In some customers I recognize kin,
and can suggest several books I'm certain they'll love, but a few
times I've gotten it completely wrong.
            
A couple weeks ago an older man came in who'd written and self
published a book about moving to Hollywood and pursuing acting as
a black man from the midwest. He'd since assigned himself all of
The Classics‚Ñ¢. He'd read _East of Eden, The Idiot, Crime and
Punishment, The Count of Monte Cristo_, but now found himself
exhausted. He felt better and more accomplished once he‚Äôd finished
these books but also wondered how to balance the task of reading 
with the desire to actually apply what you're getting from it. 
I nodded, thought for a moment, said maybe if you view a book 
more like a thing to enjoy, rather than a thing to conquer, 
you could build a relationship with reading that won't feel as
exhausting. Something less about extraction. He squinted at me.

Helen Dewitt says in _The Last Samurai_ -
          
<cite>There are people who think contraception is immoral because the
object of copulation is procreation. In a similar way there are
people who think the only reason to read a book is to write a
book; people should call up books from the dust and the dark and
write thousands of words to be sent down to the dust and the dark
which can be called up so that other people can send further
thousands of words to join them in the dust and the dark.
Sometimes a book can be called from the dust and the dark to
produce a book which can be bought in shops, and perhaps it is
interesting, but the people who buy it and read it because it is
interesting are not serious people, if they were serious they
would not care about the interest they would be writing thousands
of words to consign to the dust and the dark.</cite>
           
Colin, generally more tactful, said you've read a bunch of
really long challenging books one after the other. How about
something shorter to mix it up?
           
I thought immediately of _The Devil Finds Work_. One of my favorites
by Baldwin because it's so personal. Describing his intellectual
formation as a kid in the back theatres and libraries, his first
steps learning about and then learning to dissect the stories that
the west tells itself about itself. He describes finding
Dostoyevsy who seemed to corroborate his exact sense of alienation
from society, and its hypocrisy.
           
I ran to get this book off the shelf and pushed it into his hands,
the most perfect little book that would change his reading life
forever. He looked at the cover and said I started this a while
ago and couldn't get into it. Everyone's always talking bout
Baldwin this Baldwin that, but here he's just going on and on
about movies. I retreated to the shelf.
            
Anyways,
            
Colin recognizes my patterns and does a better job describing my
tastes than I ever could ‚Äî some kind of mindfuck, intriguing
cover, under 200 pages.
            
I'm in my room looking at my shelves right now and see _The
Ravishing of Lol V Stein_ next to _The Stranger_, next to _Regarding
the Pain of Others_. Looking around there‚Äôs _Plant Dreaming Deep_,
_Animal Farm_, _Tell Me How It Ends_, _Hiroshima Mon Amour_, _Nightwood_,
_A Small Place_, _A Man‚Äôs Place_, _Under A Glass Bell_, _The Oblivion
Seekers_, _Bluets_. The only thing these books could possibly have in
common is their length.
            
The thickest books I've read in recent memory are mostly here too
‚Äî _A Little Life_, _1Q84_, _The Savage Detectives_. The most recent,
_2666_<sup><a href="#footnote1"> 2</a></sup>, I purchased in San Antonio and left in Malaga in 
fall 2022.
           
           
Until recently, my perspective on most long novels, most long
things in general, was some combination of incredulity and
respect. To ask or expect someone to spend that much time with a
text feels so preposterous as to be admirable. Why make something
longer when you can make it shorter? 9th grade English, Mr. B‚Äôs 
red pen crossing out all my unnecessary words.
            
This is mostly where I was until I read Rachel Zucker's _Poetics of 
Wrongness_ a couple months ago. Zucker builds an entire
ethics of writing that weaves disruption, hesitation, mistakes,
and interruption into its practice. A poetics of motherhood.
Digressions become not only worthwhile but central, there‚Äôs
information in unnecessary words. If a novel or a poem is long
enough it can contain its own happening ‚Äî the experience of
reading it becomes part of its meaning.
           
[THIS](https://tinhouse.com/podcast/kate-briggs-the-long-form/) 
interview with Kate Briggs made me come back to the novel
that I‚Äôd abandoned a couple months ago because it was too long.
Listening to this  I‚Äôm seeing the book anew. One of its goals was 
to create a text that can be put down and returned to. Something 
impossible to finish in one sitting, and meant
to be interrupted, but still something to spend a lot of time
with. To pay attention to, to be devoted to. It‚Äôs almost 500 pages, 
but the chapters are generally short, a novel of fragments.
          
One of the epigraphs by Barthes, translated by Briggs goes ‚Äî  
"My problem: how to pass‚Ä¶ from a short, fragmented form (notes) to a
  long, continuous form (typically called _the novel_)."
          
And here I am, just tacking paragraph onto paragraph, hoping to
make some kind of sense, but thank you for spending time with me
here.
            
I‚Äôve been aware of this book for a while but steered well clear of
it because it‚Äôs called "The Last Samurai" and it‚Äôs by someone called
Helen DeWitt so I thought of that awful mess with Tom Cruise
(2003), but recently learned that the last samurai is in reference
to Mifune Toshio‚Äôs character in Kurosawa‚Äôs _Seven Samurai_ (1954)
and that there are parts of this book in pure Greek with no
translation. Then I opened it and the table of contents made me
smile, then I started it and couldn‚Äôt put it down for the first 70
pages which is a good sign. I think it will be interesting to
alternate between _The Long Form_ and _The Last Samurai_ for the rest
of March ‚Äî both big books about mothering that are constantly
interrupted and

<div id="footnote1"><sup>1 </sup><small>3.18.25 something about this interaction is sticking with me, 
feeling hypocritical and not generous.
I think I keep returning to short novels because of the myth that shorter 
texts can be more experimental than longer ones, and the big one, the 
little dopamine hit of finishing a book and marking it on goodreads. 
  The book as something conquered.</small></div>  
<div id="footnote2"><sup>2 </sup><small> Bola√±o was sick and died before he finished 2666. Tobi 
  told me that he considered publishing it in 5 parts to maximize royalties 
  for his kids, but they decided to publish it all together. Probably for 
  the best, because if it was split up, one entire book would have been the 
  brutal section that just details the violent murders of hundreds of women 
  in Santa Teresa.</small></div>
