august poetry book club was shima by shō yamagushiku

we talked about okinawan history and the traded property of empire[s]. we talked about property, the destructiveness of possession. we talked about the mirage of separateness, how language can box you in, being weary of names, home-making when return is an impossibility.

we talked about how the only japanese orthography in the book were the kanji in the dedication—two names—and the kanji in the acknowledgements referring to family [i think]

–okinawan languages (uchinaaguchi) are in the same language family as standard japanese, but completely distinct with no mutual intelligibility. there is no official script and each generation’s further shift away and towards standard japanese and okinawan dialect has made them endangered.
we talked about the freedom of imagination it can be to be in diaspora, rendering in latin script a language that is being actively disappeared.
latin script is an orthography with a different imperial history, not the particular weight of chinese and japanese that yields kanji and has carved okinawa, so maybe there’s a little bit of dreaming that can happen in that distance,
but then, superseding everything—empire, history—is hereness.
home is the place from which invent the world. the place that great grands or grands or parents or you left, being impossible to return to—it changed, you changed—we reinvent the world from where we are. access the old languages with the tools at our disposal now—here, latin script

we talked about “cobbling together makeshift ceremonies.” i asked where do your ceremonies come from, how do you think of ceremonies, and why are they important?

tried to reference eliade saying ceremonies are how we create sacred time, how we ascribe meaning. ceremony can be a tiny thing, but whatever it is, you’re doing it and it’s been done before and because it’s been done before the body remembers. physical and spiritual body. i trailed off because i wasn’t sure if i was making sense.

we talked about timing. i asked how would the you from 10-15 years ago have encountered this book? in our youth maybe we demand, expect certain things of home, and as we age we become more open and less grasping,

we talked about form and structure, how it felt like one long poem, each ending and beginning uncertain—oceanic. and maybe home is just the continuation of conversations. with self, with ‘other’, with place, ecologies. anything, just that it’s ongoing.

in my notebook i transcribed pretty much the whole last 3rd of the book, but all i’ll write here is -

“how far can a house of bricks be from shame, how far from guilt, how far from revenge”

and after a description of his great grandfathers life that was locations, jobs, fleeing, death, and then his great grandmother’s that followed her husband wherever he went, then interment camp, then dying two months after him, shō writes -

“with limited vision, uto might appear to follow behind her husband thru the archive. yet, her life exceeds the hard scaffolding that often marks a man’s existence. she does not need the materiality of data to become legible in the realm of the ancestors.”
